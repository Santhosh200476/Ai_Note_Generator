A turbine is a mechanical device that converts the energy of a moving fluid (such as steam, water, or air) into rotational motion. This rotational motion can then be used to generate power or perform mechanical work. Turbines work by channeling the fluid flow over blades or vanes attached to a rotor. As the fluid passes over the blades, it imparts force that causes the rotor to spin. The rotational energy of the rotor is transferred to a connected generator, pump, or other machinery to produce electricity or mechanical output.

There are various types of turbines, each designed to work with different fluid sources. Steam turbines are widely used in power plants, where steam from boiling water drives the blades. Gas turbines operate using hot gases from combustion and are commonly found in jet engines and power generation. Hydraulic turbines harness the energy of flowing water, such as in dams or rivers, to generate power. Wind turbines use the kinetic energy of the wind to generate electricity, playing a key role in renewable energy generation. Turbines are critical components in modern energy production, enabling the efficient conversion of fluid energy into useful mechanical and electrical power across a range of industries."""
